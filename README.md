================

This uses Express so run `npm install`.

Then run `node app` and it will start two servers.

Open [http://localhost:3000/]() in your browser and read the instructions. The JavaScript in index.html will make cross-origin requests to port 3001.

To see the bug, use the iOS Simulator or a real iOS device.
